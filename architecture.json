Turner, with ethereal light and sublime, emotive landscapes, rendered with thick, expressive impasto brushstrokes and a luminous, almost abstract quality to the sky and water], [Composition & Camera: book cover framing, a centered but dynamic composition where the figure is positioned off-center to the left, creating a vast empty space of sea and sky that emphasizes his isolation and the scale of his new world, shot from a low-angle to make the philosopher and the coastline monumental against the dramatic heavens], [Lighting & Color Palette: dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with the last golden rays of a setting sun breaking through tumultuous, dark clouds, casting a warm glow on the philosopher's face and the rocky outcrops, contrasted against the cool, deep blues and violets of the stormy sea and the impending night, a palette of burnt sienna, gold, Prussian blue, and charcoal], masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
